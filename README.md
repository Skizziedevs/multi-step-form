## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Vue.js store

### What I learned

- I wanted to use vue.js [teleport](https://vuejs.org/guide/built-ins/teleport.html) to create the nav buttons on mobile screens but finally, I found out that using old CSS "position: fixed" was better. Teleport had many settings I had to set up compared to the CSS solution.

- I had a performance warning in the browser due to the fixed positioning. And the solution was to use CSS [will-change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) property.

Here is how I solved the issue :

```css
.stepButtons {
  /** ... */
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
  z-index: 999;

  will-change: transform;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Deploy a vite app to Github Pages](https://dev.to/shashannkbawa/deploying-vite-app-to-github-pages-3ane) - ðŸ¥³ I actually found my solution in the top comment. I was following the article's steps but it wasn't working.
- [CSS will-change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) - This helped me to fix a performance issue I had in the browser because of the use of CSS "position: fixed;".
- [Vue.js Reactive](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#reactive) - I had some issues with the second step related to the radio inputs because I was using computed properties : when I checked them, the style for the checked state was no longer applying. So I made the variable a reactive one and used shallowRef on the icons and the issues were fixed.
